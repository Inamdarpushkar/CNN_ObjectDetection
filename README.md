# Monitoring marine traffic: satellite imagery feature detection 

Advancement of computer vison algorithms, remote sensing and geospatial technologies allow a continuous monitoring, mapping and analysis of feature events on the earth. The goal of this project was to build machine learning and computer vision models to help automate the process of classification and ships identification in multispectral satellite images. In this project, I processed and analyzed high-resolution raster dataset, built convolutional neural network (CNN) models (Gray scale input and RGB input) and deployed it in AWS.
